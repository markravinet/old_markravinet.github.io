### INSTRUCTIONS ###
# The easiest way to submit your work is use this R script as a template. You should show
# your code. You should also show the answers using the hash (#) symbol to comment them
# out.
#
# When you are finished, you can click, File>Save_as and alter the extension of the script
# from .R to .txt - this will save it as a text file which you can then upload to Canvas.
# We recommend you do this last of all, because it will destroy the syntax highlighting in
# your R code.

## 1. Using the iris dataset, visualise the difference in petal width and sepal length
##    between the species. N.B. You can use a ggplot or base R plot for this

## 2. Again using the iris dataset, calculate the mean petal width and sepal length for each of 
##    the three species. Once you have done this, do the same for the median. 
##    NB. There is a way to do all of this in a single command, it is not complusory but 
##    you are welcome to try if you are feeling adventurous! 

## 3. Use ANOVA to test whether mean petal width and sepal length differs among species. 

## 4. What proportion of the variance explained in petal width and sepal length is due to differences
##    among species?

## 5. For our QTL analysis, we genotyped our individuals at 334 markers and used an F2 intercross
##    design. The grandparents of our cross were fixed for AA and BB at each of these informative
##    markers.

##    a. Explain what we mean by an F2 intercross design

##    b. What are the expected genotype frequences among F2 individuals we used for the actual
##       QTL experiment?

## 6. Explain what a linkage map is and the units it is expressed in.
      
## 7. From the bedbug linkage map, how many markers are there on the first three linkage groups? How 
##    long are these linkage groups? What is the average spacing among markers for the entire linkage
##    map?
      
## 8. Using R code, count the number of each phenotype among the 71 F2 individuals in the QTL mapping 
##    mapping experiment

## 9. Use ANOVA to test for an association between bedbug genotype and pesticide resistance phenotype
##    at a non-qtl marker. What are the biological reasons behind this result?
