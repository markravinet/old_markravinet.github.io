### INSTRUCTIONS ###
# The easiest way to submit your work is use this R script as a template. You should show
# your code. You should also show the answers using the hash (#) symbol to comment them
# out.
# 
# When you are finished, you can click, File>Save_as and alter the extension of the script
# from .R to .txt - this will save it as a text file which you can then upload to Canvas.
# We recommend you do this last of all, because it will destroy the syntax highlighting in
# your R code.

### Discussion questions

### 1. What are absolute and relative fitness? What do we mean by marginal fitness?

### 2. What are the key components of the one-locus model of vialbility selection?

### 3. What is the difference between directional selection and balancing selection? 

### R-based questions

### 4. We sample a 315 individuals from a population of snails which have a brown/yellow polymorphism. This is
###    controlled by a single locus B. B1B1 individuals are brown, so are B1B2 individuals
###    but B2B2 is yellow. In our sample, 184 snails are B1B1, 60 are B1B2 and 81 are B2B2.
###    We know from our experimental work that on average, brown individuals have 33 offspring,
###    whereas yellow individuals have 24. Calculate the following:

###   a. the frequency of the B1 and B2 alleles

###   b. the relative fitnesses 

###   c. the marginal fitness

###   d. the mean population fitness.

### 5. Using R code we learned during the tutorial, simulate selection over 100 generations
###    for a case where A1A1 has the highest fitness and the relative fitness of the genotypes A1A2 and A2A2 is 0.4. The initial
###    of the A1 allele is 0.01. Plot the frequency of p over the generations. 
###    Is A1 dominant, additive or recessive? What can we infer from the plot? 

### N.B You must define the function in your code
