## Reference-mapped RAD analysis

### Introduction

For the first session today, we will try our hand at analysing RAD data when we have reference genome available. First we will map our data to the reference genome, then we will call SNPs, perform some simple filtering and quality checking steps before plotting genome-wide _F_~ST~ estimates.

We are going to be working on double-digested RAD seq data from a Canadian population of three-spined sticklebacks (_Gasterosteus aculeatus_). The Little Campbell stream is famous in stickleback evolutionary biology because it is one of the first places that marine and freshwater stickleback morphs were explained in detail (Hagen & McPhail 1967). 

---

### 1. Getting started

As you will no doubt be aware, running NGS analyses locally on your computer is often not feasible! As with the majority of all tutorials throughout this course, we will be working on the EVOP server.

#### Logging in and setting up

To login, use `ssh` or a similar shell client, like so: 

	ssh mark@evopserver.bioinf.uni-leipzig.de
	
Once you are logged in, familiarise yourself with your surroundings. You should have already learned some Unix commands by now but use `ls` to see everything present in your home directory. We are going to do all our work in a special directory which we need to create. Use the following commands to do so:

	cd ~
	mkdir ref_rad
	cd ref_rad

#### What are fastq files?


Before we can actually do any analysis, we are going to need to get some data. Typically for an analysis like this, you will recieve sequencing data as a large [fastq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTQ_format) file which you need to demultiplex (i.e. breakdown into files for separate individuals). For the sake of convenience today, all have already been demultiplexed and quality checked, so we can get started straight away. Let's have a look at the data.

	cd /homes/evopserver/lectures/NGS-NonModelOrganism/ref/raw_100k
	ls
	
You should see a big list of files that all end with **fastq.gz**. These are gzipped fastq files - raw sequencing data for each individual in the study. Use the following command to take a closer look at the first individual:

	zcat LCM10_1.fastq.gz | head -4
	
You should see the first full lines of the first fastq file (**note:** here the file is truncuated - you will see more bases).

```
@MG00HS09:622:C695WACXX:7:1101:7183:1964 1:N:0:CTGGTT
TTTCAAATGGTTTTCCCCTCGTCAAGTAAGAGAACACAAAGGAATGTTGAGGA
+
CCCFFFEFHHFHHJJIJJJJJIJJJJHIIJJJJJJJJJJJIJJGIJIJJJJII
```

What do these lines mean?

* **Line 1:** Sequence id: this is usually the Illumina machine identifier and cell coordinate. The string after the space here tells us this is the first (forward) read of a paired-end sequencing project. The final 6 basepairs are the library code
* **Line 2:** This should be familiar! This is the raw sequence
* **Line 3:** A spacer line - contains only '+'
* **Line 4:** Quality scores - here they are encoded as Phred33

#### Manipulating fastq files

An important task for any budding bioinformatician is to calculate how many reads are present for each individual. Use the following code to do this:

	zcat LCM10_1.fastq.gz | wc -l
	
Here we have piped the file (using `zcat`) to `wc`which with the `-l`flag will count the number of lines in the field. Remember that there are four lines per read from above so it should be easy to calculate the number of reads present here. Alternatively if you are lazy (like me!) you could use another tool like `awk` to calculate the exact number of sequences

	zcat LCM10_1.fastq.gz  | wc -l | awk '{print $1/4}'

Usually, a single fastq file will contain millions of reads. To make our practical today more manageable, I have subsampled the dataset to include only the first 100k reads for each individual. If you are running through a pipeline for the first time, it is often worth doing this to make sure everything works properly and then repeating it with the full size data. 

Use `ls -lah` to have look at the contents of the directory again. You will now see the size of the files; without subsampling, these would be >500 mb each and be much more difficult to manage in a short period of time.

You should also note the name of the files. We have two types of sample here, those starting with `LCM` and those with `LCS` which are Little Campbell marine and stream fish respectively. Also note how there are two files for each individual, this is because of paired-end sequencing. Those with `_1` are forward reads, those with `_2` are reverse reads.

#### Get the data

The final step here is to copy these files to your home directory. Use the following code:

```
cd ~/ref_rad
mkdir raw
cp /homes/evopserver/lectures/NGS-NonModelOrganism\
/ref/raw_100k/*fastq.gz ./raw/
```

---

### 2. Aligning to the reference genome

#### Finding the reference genome

We are going to align our data to an updated version of the stickleback reference genome, described in Roesti _et al._ (2013). 

You will find a copy of this reference genome in my lecture files directory. Copy it your own directory using the following code.

```
cd ~/ref_rad
cp /homes/evopserver/lectures/\
NGS-NonModelOrganism/ref/Gac_ac_rm_Roesti.fa ./
```

In order to align to the genome, we are going to use `bowtie2` which is a nice and very fast aligner. See [here](http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/index.shtml) for more details on bowtie2.

#### Indexing the reference genome

Before we can actually perform an alignment, we need to index the reference genome we just copied to our home directories. This essentially produces an index for rapid searching and aligning. Use the following command:

	bowtie2-build Gac_ac_rm_Roesti.fa gac
	
For our purposes today, it takes too long to run this command so once you've initated the command, press `ctrl + c` to kill it. Note that the second part of this command, `gac` is the name for index of our reference genome. Use `ls` to see that you have created a number of files with `gac` as the prefix. 

To save time, we will copy some already built indexes to our home directory

	cd ~/ref_rad
	cp /homes/evopserver/lectures/NGS-NonModelOrganism/ref/gac* ./
	
#### Performing a paired end alignment

Now we are ready to align our sequences! To simplify matters, we will first try this on a single individual. First create a directory to hold our aligned data:

	cd ~/ref_rad
	mkdir align
	
As a side note, it is good practice to keep your data well organised like this, otherwise things can become confusing and difficult in the future.

To align our individual we will use `bowtie2`. You might want to first have a look at the options available for it by calling `bowtie2 --help`

We align paired-end reads like so:

	bowtie2 -x ./gac -1 ./raw/LCM10_1.fastq.gz \
	-2 ./raw/LCM10_2.fastq.gz \
	-N 0 -p 4 \
	-S ./align/LCM10.sam
	
Be prepared, this will take a a minute or two. In the meantime, what have we done here?

* `-x` specifies the reference genome index to use
* `-1` tells bowtie2 where the forward reads are
* `-2` tells bowtie2 where the reverse reads are
* `-N` is the number of mismatches allowed in the read seed
* `-p` is the number of threads to run the command on
* `-S` is the output - here we are writing it as a SAM file.

Once your alignment has ended, you will see some alignment statistcs written to the screen. We will come back to these later.


#### SAM files

Lets take a closer a look at the output. To do this we will use `samtools`. More details on `samtools` can be found [here](http://www.htslib.org/doc/samtools.html)

	cd align
	samtools view -h LCM10.sam | head
	samtools view LCM10.sam | head
	
This is a SAM file - or sequence alignment/map format. It is basically a text format for storing an alignment. The format is made up of a header where each line begins with `@`, which we saw when we used the `-h` flag and an alignment section. 

The header gives us details on what has been done to the SAM, where it has been aligned and so on. We will not focus on it too much here but there is a very detailed SAM format specification [here](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf).

The alignment section is more informative at this stage and it has at least 11 fields. The most important for now are the first four. Take a closer look at them.  

	samtools view LCM10.sam | head |Â cut -f 1-4

Here we have:

* The sequence ID
* The flag - these have various meanings, 0 = mapped, 4 = unmapped
* Reference name - reference scaffold the read maps to
* Position - the mapping position/coordinate for the read

**Note!!** The other fields are important, but for our purposes we will not examine them in detail here.

Now, lets look at the mapping statistics again:

	samtools flagstat LCM10.sam
	
This shows us that a total of 200k reads were read in (forward and reverse), that around 79% mapped successfully, 64% mapped with their mate pair, 10% were singletons and the rest did not map.

#### BAM files

One problem with SAM files is that for large amounts of sequence data, they can rapidly become HUGE in size. As such, you will often see them stored as BAM files (Binary Aligment/Mapping format). A lot of downstream analyses require the BAM format so our next task is to convert our SAM to a BAM.

	samtools view LCM10.sam -b -o LCM10.bam
	
Here the `-b` flag tells `samtools` to output a BAM and `-o` identifies the output path.

You can view bamfiles in the same way as before.

	samtools view LCM10.bam | head
	
Note that the following will not work (although it does for SAM) because it is a binary format

	head LCM10.bam
	
	
Before we can proceed to more exciting analyses, there is one more step we need to perform - sorting the bamfile. Most downstream analyses require this in order to function efficiently
	
	samtools sort LCM10.bam -o LCM10_sort.bam
	
Once this is run, we will have a sorted bam for downstream analysis! However as you may have noticed, we have only performed this on a single SAM output so far... what if we want to do it on multiple individuals? Do we need to type all this everytime?

#### Using bash scripts to work on multiple files

Rather than typing out each command, we can use a bash script. For ease today, I have provided one for you. Copy it to your home directory and take a look:

```
cd ~/ref_rad
cp /homes/evopserver/lectures/NGS-NonModelOrganism\
/ref/scripts/align_sort.sh
less align_sort.sh
```

This looks complex but it isn't really. The first line is:

	#!/bin/sh

Which just declares the shell - it tells the script to run in bash. Note that # indicates this line is a comment.

We declare an array like so:

	INDS=($(for i in ./raw/*.fastq.gz; do echo $(basename 	${i%_*}); done | uniq))
	
This basically produces a list of file names to use inside the bash for loop.

Next is the for loop - it is identical to the commands we ran previously except that it takes each individual in the list of individuals and runs it for each of them.

Explaining this bash file in depth is outside of the scope of this exercise but it is worth learning how to write a script like this yourself as it will make your life much much easier.
	
So now that you have a rough idea of what the bash script does, you can run it like so:

	bash align_sort.sh
	
Once all the reads are aligned, sorted and converted to BAMs, we are ready to move on to the next step.

**Note! If this is taking too long or you are running out of time, you can copy bams I have already aligned and sorted into your home directory. Just do the following**

```
cd ~/ref_rad/align/
cp /homes/evopserver/lectures/NGS-NonModelOrganism\
/ref/align/*_sort.bam ./
```
---


### 3. Calling variants

If everything has worked correctly up to this point, we now have a set of sequence reads that are aligned to our reference genome. What we want to do now is to call variants from these alignments.

**Disclaimer: There are many ways to perform variant calling for RAD-seq data - bcftools, GATK, Stacks - this is just an example. You should evaluate which tool will be best for your purposes with your own data.**

To call variants today, we will use `bcftools` which is designed by the same team behind `samtools` - they are part of the same pipeline. `bcftools` is itself a comprehensive pipeline and produces a variant call format (vcf) that is used in many downstream analyses. 

#### Indexing the reference... again

The first thing we need to do is index our reference genome again. This actually needs to be done with `samtools`. Return to the home directory and perform the following actions

	cd ~/ref_rad/
	samtools faidx Gac_ac_rm_Roesti.fa
	
Let's take a closer look at that index.

	head Gac_ac_rm_Roesti.fa.fai 

You don't need to worry about this in great deal but for clarity, the columns are: chromsome name, chromosome length, offset of the first base, fasta line length, fasta line length + 1.

#### Setting environmental variables

With this step done, we are nearly ready to call variants. To keep the command line clear, we are going to set an important environmental variable like so:

	REF=~/ref_rad/Gac_ac_rm_Roesti.fa

What exactly are we doing here? Well we are declaring a variable in the `bash` environment. So from now on `$REF`will refer to the path of the reference genome. This means rather than typing the whole path, we can use `$REF` to access it. To see a  variable, type `echo $REF` (or whatever the variable is called). This is a really useful thing to incorporate in to bash scripts to make them easy to use for different projects.

#### Calling variants

To call variants, we will first use the `samtools mpileup` tool to pileup our BAM files. What does this mean exactly? Well we will take all reads at a given position and call variants from the reads covering that position. We need to do this for all individuals.

After performing the pileup, we than pass the output to `bcftools call` which will actually call variants. To see the options available to each part of the pipeline, just type their names into the command line.

Rather than perform each step previously as we did before, here we will use pipes - `|` - to pass data from each part of the pipeline to the next. Rather than explaining every point now, it's best we just perform the calling and break it down later.

	cd ~/ref_rad/
	samtools mpileup -Rug -t DP,DV -C 50 -f $REF \
	./align/*_sort.bam | bcftools call -f GQ,GP \
	-vmO z -o ./stickleback.vcf.gz
	
While this is running, let's go through the options and get an idea of what we did.

For `samtools mpileup`:

* `-R` - ignores read group data - so each BAM is an individual
* `-u` - Do not compress the output
* `-g` - Generate genotype likelihoods in BCF format (don't worry too much about this)
* `-t` - output tags - here we are telling `mpileup` to output depth and depth per variant data (this will be clearer later)
* `-f` - the location of the reference sequence

For `bcftools call`:

* `-f` - format fields for the vcf - here they are genotype quality and genotype probability
* `-v` - output variant sites only - i.e. ignore non-variant parts of the reads
* `-m`- use bcftools multiallelic caller 
* `-O`- specify the output type, here it is `z` - i.e. gzipped (compressed) vcf
* `-o` output path

In essence, we have piled up each read against each genome position and then called variants where there are enough alternative reads to support the presence of a variant.

**If the previous step worked, you should now have a nice vcf file available to view. If not, you can copy one I made for you earlier like so:**

```
cd ~/ref_rad/
cp /homes/evopserver/lectures/NGS-NonModelOrganism\
/ref/vcf/stickleback.vcf.gz ./
```

#### Exploring vcf files

First, a bit of housekeeping. Make a vcf directory and move the vcf into it.

	cd ~/ref_rad
	mkdir vcf
	mv stickleback.vcf.gz ./vcf
	cd vcf

vcf stands for 'variant call format' and is a standard format used for variant calling and in population genomics. Again a detailed specification can be found [online](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/VCFv4.2.pdf). It can take a bit of getting used to but it is widely supported and very useful. Let's have a look at the vcf. 

	bcftools view -h stickleback.vcf.gz

A lot of information will flash by - this is the vcf header. Like the SAM file, the header contains information on what has been done to the vcf. The last line is particularly important as it shows what each field in the main body of the vcf is and it also gives the individual names. Try the following:

	bcftools view -h stickleback.vcf.gz | head
	bcftools view -h stickleback.vcf.gz | tail
	
Here `-h` means show me only the header. You can also see `-H` to see only the raw calls. For some more information on the vcf format, see here.

A nice feature of vcf files is that you can access almost any part of the genome you are interested in. To do this though, you need to index the vcf first. Simply do the following

	bcftools index -t stickleback.vcf.gz
	
Let's see what variants are present at the start of chrIV:

	bcftools view -H -r chrIV stickleback.vcf.gz | head
	
Here the `-r` flag specfies the region of the genome to examine. We can achieve the same effect by specifying the base pair coordinates

	bcftools view -H -r chrIV:1-10000 stickleback.vcf.gz
	
Now you're probably wondering what exactly all this data actually means. Let's explore in a bit more detail.

	bcftools view -h stickleback.vcf.gz | tail -1 | cut -f 1-9
	bcftools view -H stickleback.vcf.gz | head -1 | cut -f 1-9
	
These are the first 11 fields of the vcf and they are always present. What do they mean?

* `CHROM` - chromosome or scaffold id from the reference genome
* `POS` - base pair reference position
* `ID` - SNP id - blank in this case
* `REF`- Reference base - A,C,G,T or N. More than one indicates an indel
* `ALT` - Alternaate base - the alternate base called as a variant
* `QUAL` - Phred quality score for alternate base call (site not individual)
* `FILTER` - filter status - if PASS then all filters passed
* `INFO` - additional info on each site - explanation stored in header
* `FORMAT`- the format for the genotype fields

There is a lot of information here! Don't worry too much if it doesn't make perfect sense immediately - familiarity with this format will come with time and experience.

Let's look at the the first site again in detail:

```
bcftools view stickleback.vcf.gz | grep -m 1 -A 1 "#CHROM" | cut -f 1-7
```

You should see this:

```
#CHROM	POS	ID	REF	ALT	QUAL	FILTER
chrI	6258	.	C	A	87	.
```

Which means we have a variant at 6258 on chr1. The reference base is C, alternate base is A. There are no filters.

Have a look at the info field with the following code

```
bcftools view stickleback.vcf.gz | grep -m 1 -A 1 "#CHROM" | cut -f 8
```
You can find out what these mean by grepping the header. 

	bcftools view -h stickleback.vcf.gz | grep "INFO"

So for example, DP here means the raw read depth for the entire site.

What about the actual genotype information? Firstly it is wise to look at the format here.

```
bcftools view stickleback.vcf.gz | grep -m 1 -A 1 "#CHROM" | cut -f 9
```

To investigate what these mean, grep the header again.

	bcftools view -h stickleback.vcf.gz | grep "FORMAT"


Now let's take a look at the call for the first individual.

```
bcftools view stickleback.vcf.gz | grep -m 1 -A 1 "#CHROM" | cut -f 10
```

This will return:

```
./align/LCM10_sort.bam
0/1:0,3,42:1:0:4,1,40:4
```

The first line is obviously the name of the sample, then we have the genotype. Here `0` always denotes the reference, `1` the alternate base so we can see this individual is heterozygote for the `REF` and `ALT` bases. We will ignore the genotype likelhood for now. You can see there is 1 read in total covering this site and no reads for the variant - meaning this genotype call is obviously wrong.

One of the reasons for this is the fact we used such a tiny dataset. So in the next section we will look at a proper set of variant calls from multiple individuals.

---


### 4. Filtering variants

#### Get some real data

At this point our subsetted dataset kind of breaks down as we do not have enough reads or coverage to call a decent variant set

To rememdy this, we are going to use a vcf I have prepared using a **full dataset of 40 individuals**. To get the full dataset into your directory, use the following commands:

```
cd ~/ref_rad/vcf
cp /homes/evopserver/lectures/NGS-NonModelOrganism\
/ref/vcf/stickleback_full_unfiltered.vcf.gz* ./
```
	
This will copy both the vcf and its index to your directory.
	
	  
#### How many unfiltered variants?

One thing we didn't check yet is how many variants we actually have. Each line in the main output of a vcf represents a single call so we can use the following code to work it out:

	bcftools view -H stickleback_full_unfiltered.vcf.gz | wc -l

That's a substantial number of calls! But chances are many of them are not useful for our analysis because they occur in too few individuals, their minor allele frequency is too low or they are covered by insufficient depth. 

Up until now, we have not filtered any sites at all. I personally prefer to keep as many variants in the analysis as possible and then only filter at the final step. I also prefer to do a bit of initial analysis to get an idea of how to set the filters. I will give one example of that here - for sequencing depth.

To perform filtering and to generally get an idea of what sort of information our vcf contains, we are going to use `vcftools`, [a very useful and fast program for handling vcf files](https://vcftools.github.io/examples.html).

#### Getting an idea of how to set filters

How do you set filters for your dataset? This isn't actually an easy question to answer but there are a few basics you should always filter on - depth, genotype quality and minor allele frequency.

Ideally you should use `vcftools`to get an idea for yor data - plot the distribution of allele frequencies or genotype depth for example. We donÂ´t have time for that today so instead we will use some approximate rules that should provide decent results.

* **Depth:** You should always include a minimum depth filter and ideally also a maximum depth one too. Minimum will prevent false positive calls (like the one we saw earlier) and will ensure higher quality calls too. A maximum cut off is important because regions with very, very high read depths are likely repetitive ones mapping to multiple parts of the genome.
* **Quality** Genotype quality is also an important filter - essentially you should not trust any genotype with a Phred score below 20 which suggests 99% accuracy.
* **Minor allele frequency** MAF can cause big problems with SNP calls - and also inflate statistical estimates downstream. Ideally you want an idea of the distribution of your allelic frequencies but 0.05 to 0.10 is a reasonable cut-off.
* **Missing data** How much missing data are you willing to tolerate? It will depend on the study but any site with >25% missing data should be dropped.

#### Filtering the vcf

Now we have an idea of how to filter our vcf, we will do just that. Run the following `vcftools` command on the data to produce a filtered vcf. We will investigate the options after the filtering is run.

```
vcftools --gzvcf stickleback_full_unfiltered.vcf.gz \
--remove-indels --maf 0.05 --max-missing 0.75 \
--minDP 10 --maxDP 200 --recode --stdout | gzip -c > \
stickleback_full_filtered.vcf.gz 

```

What have we done here?

* `--gvcf` - input path -- denotes a gzipped vcf file
* `--remove-indels` - remove all indels (SNPs only)
* `--maf` - set minor allele frequency - 0.05 here
* `--max-missing` - set minimum missing data. A little counterintuitive - 0 is totally missing, 1 is none missing. Here 0.75 means we will tolerate 25% missing data.
* `--recode` - recode the output - necessary to output a vcf
* `--stdout` - pipe the vcf out to the stdout (easier for file handling)

Now, how many variants remain? There are two ways to examine this - look at the vcftools log or the same way we tried before.

	cat out.log
	bcftools view -H stickleback_full_filtered.vcf.gz | wc -l
	
You can see we have substantially filtered our dataset!

Have a closer look at the vcf before moving on to the next step to get an idea of what a proper variant call with multiple individuals looks like

**NB. Because the full vcf was generated for a proper dataset, it was not created in exactly the same way as the one we made today - so be aware there will be some differences - i.e. filenames, pipeline etc**

---


### 5. Estimating population genomic statistics

Now we are finally at the stage that many of you will want to reach with your own organisms - performing population genomic analyses. Here we will carry out a simple analysis - estimating  genome-wide _F_~ST~ from our RAD_seq data. 

#### Getting sample lists

Once again we will use `vcftools`. Before we can perform this analysis though we need to get a list of the samples in the vcf file. Luckily I have two prepared for you.

```
cd ~/rad_ref/vcf/
cp homes/evopserver/lectures/NGS-NonModelOrganism/ref/other/L* ./
cat L*
```
	
You should now see a list of samples. One of these files `LCS_samples.txt` is a list of individuals from the Little Campbell stream, the other, `LCM_samples.txt` is for Little Campbell marine fish.

#### Estimating per-site _F_~ST~

Now we have a list of samples for each population, we can perform _F_~ST~ estimates. First we will do this on a site by site basis. 

```
vcftools --gzvcf stickleback_full_filtered.vcf.gz \
--weir-fst-pop LCM_samples.txt \
--weir-fst-pop LCS_samples.txt \
--out full_site
```

Here the `--weir-fst-pop` option is specified twice, to let `vcftools` know we want _F_~ST~ calculations between these two populations. `--out` specifies an output prefix.

This analysis is extremely quick. Let's look at the output.

	head full_site.weir.fst
	
You can see now that there are _F_~ST~ estimates for each site in our vcf file.

#### Estimating sliding window _F_~ST~

One big feature of working with genomic data is the **huge** number of sites you need to deal with. Plotting >4000 SNPs can be very noisy (as you will see shortly) so it is often easier to perform sliding window estimates of  _F_~ST~ - i.e. _F_~ST~ averaged over a set genome-window. Here we will use 250 kb non-overlapping windows.

```
vcftools --gzvcf stickleback_full_filtered.vcf.gz \
--weir-fst-pop LCM_samples.txt \
--weir-fst-pop LCS_samples.txt \
--fst-window-size 250000 --fst-window-step 250000 \
--out full_site
```
This is almost identical to the command we ran previously except that now we have specified a window size with `--fst-window-size` and a window step with `--fst-window-step`. If we wanted a smoothed sliding average, we could have set the step to lower than window size, but for now this will do.

Let's look at the output:

	head full_site.windowed.weir.fst 

Now we have mean estimates for 250 kb windows!

**Note:**  this is only one of many, many analyses you could perform. Pipelines such as `vcftools` have many options to compute population genomic statistics on vcf files. You might also want to consider `PopGenome`, an `R` package, the `Python` libraries `egg-lib` and `pyvcf` amongst others. Of course if you're feeling particularly daring, you can write your own...
___

### 6. Visualising the data

Now we have reached the final step of this exercise. There are lots of different options for visualising the data. Personally, I prefer `R`. Since you will not be learning `R` properly until later in the course, I will not go into much detail here.

To make things run more smoothly, I have written an `R` script that will create a plot for you. You are more than welcome to look at this script in detail and feel free to ask me questions about it. If you are already sufficient in `R` (or any other plotting utility for that matter), you are also more than welcome to attempt your own plot.

First copy the `R` script to your directory:

```
cd ~/ref_rad/vcf
cp /homes/evopserver/lectures/NGS-NonModelOrganism\
/ref/scripts/fst_plotter.R ./
```

Now we will run the `R` script like a program:

```
Rscript fst_plotter.R -s full_site.weir.fst \
-w full_site.windowed.weir.fst -o fst_plot.pdf
```

If you want to know more about the options, run `Rscript fst_plotter.R -h`. This should produce a nice genome-wide _F_~ST~ plot as a pdf for you to look at. Again, feel free to look at the mechanics of the `fst_plotter.R` script using `less` or `nano`. I'm happy to answer questions on it for those interested.
