## Concluding remarks

After completeing these two exercises, you should have a good idea of how to go from bare-bones sequencing data to a high quality SNP or RAD locus dataset.

Of course, it's important to keep in mind that these exercises are only meant as a guide and are not a definitive set of instructions. One of the nice things about population genomic analysis is that you can be very flexible and take things in whatever direction best suits your data.

There are many, many resources available out there and programs are always changing. Chances are that by the time you get to use some of these skills on your own data, the pipelines used here will have been updated and altered. The best advice I can give you for your own data is that you should work with it again and again. For many of my projects, I have repeated analyses often more than 3 times.

This might seem like a nightmare to some but it really is the best way to learn these programs, scripting languages and analysis methods. Have fun and don't worry about asking questions - most people are new to bioinformatics!
