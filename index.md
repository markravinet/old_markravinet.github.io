# Welcome to my github repository

I am an evolutionary biologist based at the Centre for Ecological and Evolutionary Synthesis at the University of Oslo, Norway. I work on evolutionary, speciation and population genomics. You can find a bit more about me [here](http://www.mn.uio.no/cees/english/people/researcher-postdoc/msravine/) and see some of my work [here](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=GfpvKBwAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).

## EVOP 2017 exercises

The exercises I wrote for NGS for non-model organisms module of the 2017 [Programming for Evolutionary Biology course in Leipzig](http://evop.bioinf.uni-leipzig.de/?page_id=7), Germany are available here.

- [Reference-mapped RAD analysis with sticklebacks](exercise_1_reference.md)
- [_denovo_ assembly RAD analaysis with cichlids](exercise_2_denovo.md)

## Slightly less serious

I would highly, highly recommend [this](http://musicforprogramming.net/) as a way to break through the drudgery of coding.
